Description: Android SDK Documentation from Google
 This package will download the Android SDK Documentation from Google and
 create a Debian package.  This package also aims to strip out all calls to
 the networking, including tracking services like Google Analytics and
 Doubleclick. These documentation files still require the Google "jsapi",
 which is only available by fetching it each time from
 http://www.google.com/jsapi.  This package forces it to use https://, but
 otherwise, these docs have to phone home in order for any of the javascript
 to work.
 .
 WARNING: Installing this Debian package causes docs-23_r01.zip to be
 downloaded from https://dl.google.com. Also, since Google is often
 blocked in China, the install process will try again on Chinese
 mirrors if the Google central download repo is not available.  Since
 the zipball is checked against the embedded SHA1 checksum, the
 install will fail if the mirror contains a corrupted version.

 the content is licensed under Creative Commons CC-BY 2.5.  The CC-BY

 This package avoids the issue all together since each user directly
 downloads the files from Google, and must agree to Google's license.
